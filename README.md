#The entire dialogue of Abbott &amp; Costello's "Who's On First"
print "Abbott: Well Costello, I'm going to New York with you. You know Bucky Harris, the Yankee's manager, gave me a job as coach for as long as you're on the team."
print "Costello: Look Abbott, if you're the coach, you must know all the players."
print "Abbott: I certainly do."
print "Costello: Well you know I've never met the guys. So you'll have to tell me their names, and then I'll know who's playing on the team."
print "Abbott: Oh, I'll tell you their names, but you know it seems to me they give these ball players now-a-days very peculiar names."
print "Costello: You mean funny names?"
print "Abbott: Strange names, pet names...like Dizzy Dean..."
print "Costello: His brother Daffy."
print "Abbott: Daffy Dean..."
print "Costello: And their French cousin."
print "Abbott: French?"
print "Costello: Goofe."
print "Abbott: Goofe Dean. Well, let's see, we have on the bags, Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third..."
print "Costello: That's what I want to find out."
print "Abbott: I say Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third."
print "Costello: Are you the manager?"
print "Abbott: Yes."
print "Costello: You gonna be the coach too?"
print "Abbott: Yes."
print "Costello: And you don't know the fellow's names?"
print "Abbott: Well I should."
print "Costello: Well then who's on first?"
print "Abbott: Yes."
print "Costello: I mean the fellow's name."
print "Abbott: Who."

print "Abbott: Who."
print "Costello: The guy that gets..."
print "Abbott: That's it."
print "Costello: Who gets the money..."
